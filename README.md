# Thank you for your time

Hi! I hope that you will enjoy reading my project.
I created this project using create-react-app and I used those libraries:

1.  React (17.0.2)
2.  Typescript
3.  React-router-dom
4.  Styled-components
5.  Material-ui
6.  React-lottie (animations)
7.  React-hook-form
8.  Yup
9.  Axios
10. Moment.js

For starting the project locally you just need to run `npm i` after you clone the project and run `npm start` command :)
